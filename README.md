# Book Store - Offline First Progressive App

This project was generated based on a MEAN stack project named Book Store that I worked on before.

The purpose of this project is to enable PWA features, such as offline capability, background data synchronization, and add to home screen, for the Book Store app.

The frontend app is being hosted on GitHub Pages while the backend app is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. The database used in this project is MongoDB Atlas.
